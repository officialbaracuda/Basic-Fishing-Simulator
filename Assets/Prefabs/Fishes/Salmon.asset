  description: 'Salmon is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in
    the family Salmonidae. Typically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water,
    migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations
    of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives.'
